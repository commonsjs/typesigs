# Universal (Common / Shared) Attribute Categories for Punk (Pixel) Characters / Heads


## Intro

The "classic" punk pixel characters / heads series started out with "pre-made" archetypes
 and added accessories a.k.a attributes - not officially assigned to any category such as hair,
make-up (eyes), mouth prop, face blemishes, emotion / mouth expression and so on.

The first rarity collection analyzers and  market buy & sell trade trackers started
assigning categories to the accessories a.ka. attributes and than
the category "ontology" got copied and copied and copied and really never reworked.


Let's start today (a working group - or is it my humble self on my own again)
with an universal (common / shared ) attribute category "ontology"
for all punk pixel characters / heads, shall we?
