## Intro

A scam alert reminder:  The Matt & John's® Punks V1 & V2 (blockchain database) token "non-fungible" or otherwise  are a gigantic billion $$$ con-art fraud.

It's all about numbers go up and for early "investors" to pump up the token to dump onto greater fool crypto bros HODLing the bag, isn't it?

Let's talk about the 24x24 pixel "art" or bitmap, shall we?   The punk (token) market data and price has been analyzed and tracked to death (without actually looking into the massive fraud called "wash trading / self-dealing" on a zero-fee & anonymous / pseudonymous self-service crypto bro market) -  anyways, here's a question to you and proof no. 1.

Please, tell us all the hair colors in the punk (& punkette) pixel character heads - please list the colors (e.g. blonde, white, red, etc.)  by male / female and zombie, ape, aliens.   Anyone?

Let's ask and [**search the all-knowning internets**](https://www.google.com/search?q=crypto+punks+hair+colors), shall we?   Zero. Zilch. Nada.   (For fun [**try a search on floor (minimum) price**](https://www.google.com/search?q=crypto+punks+floor+price). See the difference?  Coinbase, Crypto Slam, Coin Market Cap and on and on and on and on and on and on and on ...)
